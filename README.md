Smaller Projects done in MERN for practice:

1) Box-Generator:
   Comprised of two components: The first component is a form that takes in a color. Upon submit, a box will be generated in the second (display) component and input will be cleared. <br> <br>
   Concepts used: Lifting State, Iterating with map, modularizing components, rendering with useState
